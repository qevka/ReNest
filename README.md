# Core Features
>   * Getx State Management (dependency injection / MVC).
>   * Ability to Complete and unComplete Tasks.
>   * Search Tasks.
>   * Add new tasks (from static list for now).
>   * View Current tasks by priority or completed task list.

# Architectural Notes
>   * Unit Test Coverage at 90%.
>   * Test show examples of testing with each test category (controller, model, and widgets).
>   * Models use Build_value, Json_annotation, and Json_Serializable to automate model generation.

## Potential Improvements
>   * Unit Tests more separated. 
      > (mock controllers ect, make it so only one thing is being tested at a time.)
>   * Delete Tasks
>   * Add Custom Tasks
>   * Store tasks on server or locally.
